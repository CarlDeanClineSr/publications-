        "**1. Muon Charge Sum & Asymmetry:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mean (~0.03):** This indicates a slight overall positive charge imbalance among muons per event, which might suggest a subtle preference for positive muons over negative ones in this dataset.\n",
        "*   **Median (0.00):** The median being zero shows that in roughly half the events, the net muon charge is zero or balanced.\n",
        "*   **Asymmetry (0.0358):** A small positive charge asymmetry confirms the slight excess of positive muons. This could be relevant for anti-matter asymmetry studies if it deviates significantly from theoretical predictions for balanced particle-antiparticle production.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Tau Charge Sum & Asymmetry:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mean (~0.05):** Similar to muons, there's a slight positive charge imbalance among taus per event.\n",
        "*   **Median (0.00):** The median being zero implies charge balance in many events.\n",
        "*   **Asymmetry (0.0279):** A small positive charge asymmetry for taus is observed, also indicating a slight excess of positive taus. Like muons, this could be a point of interest for anti-matter asymmetry if not accounted for by known physics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Total Lepton HT (Scalar Sum of Transverse Momenta):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mean (152.90 GeV):** The average total transverse momentum carried by all muons and taus in an event is about 153 GeV. This provides a measure of the overall activity or energy scale of lepton production.\n",
        "*   **Std Dev (187.56 GeV):** The high standard deviation indicates a wide spread in HT values, suggesting a diverse range of event types with varying lepton activities.\n",
        "*   **Min (0.00 GeV):** Events with 0 HT imply no reconstructed leptons, or very low pT leptons that did not pass selection.\n",
        "*   **Max (~109.5 TeV):** The extremely high maximum HT suggests some events contain very energetic leptons, possibly from rare or high-energy processes.\n",
        "*   **Median (124.85 GeV):** The median is slightly lower than the mean, indicating a right-skewed distribution, where a large number of events have lower HT, but a few events have very high HT, pulling the mean up.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Leading Muon-Tau Invariant Mass:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mean (45.38 GeV):** The average invariant mass of the leading muon-tau pair is about 45 GeV, but this is heavily influenced by the distribution shape.\n",
        "*   **Std Dev (74.91 GeV):** A very large standard deviation suggests a broad distribution of invariant masses, indicating that various processes contribute to muon-tau pair production.\n",
        "*   **Min (1.83 GeV):** The minimum is close to the sum of muon and tau masses, as expected.\n",
        "*   **Max (~5.7 TeV):** The presence of very high invariant masses suggests events with highly energetic muon-tau pairs, possibly from decays of heavy particles or high-energy interactions.\n",
        "*   **Median (5.63 GeV):** The median is much lower than the mean, confirming a heavily right-skewed distribution. The peak in the histogram (not explicitly in statistics, but implied by the low median relative to the mean) at lower masses is expected from ordinary particle decays, while the long tail towards higher masses could contain signatures of new physics or rare Standard Model processes. Anomalies or distinct peaks in this distribution could point towards exotic particles that decay into muon-tau pairs, which might be related to 'vacuum tension'.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the statistical analyses provide quantitative insights into the distributions of these observables. The charge asymmetries are small but non-zero, warranting further investigation in the context of anti-matter asymmetry. The broad range of HT and invariant masses suggests a rich physics landscape within the dataset, with the invariant mass distribution being particularly interesting for potential new physics signatures related to 'vacuum tension'."

        "\n",
        "### Q&A\n",
        "*   **What was found regarding Anti-Matter Asymmetry?**\n",
        "    A slight positive charge asymmetry was observed for both muons ($\\sim0.0358$) and taus ($\\sim0.0279$), indicating a minor excess of positively charged leptons in the analyzed dataset.\n",
        "*   **What was found regarding Vacuum Tension (0.15)?**\n",
        "    The distribution of the leading muon-tau invariant mass did not show any distinct narrow peaks or unexpected deviations that would strongly suggest a new particle or phenomenon related to \"vacuum tension\" at a specific mass scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The 'Events' tree contained kinematic and charge branches for muons and taus (e.g., `Muon_pt`, `Muon_eta`, `Muon_phi`, `Muon_charge`, `Tau_pt`, `Tau_eta`, `Tau_phi`, `Tau_charge`), but **no branches for electrons** were found.\n",
        "*   The first 1 million entries of the identified muon and tau branches were successfully loaded.\n",
        "*   Per-event charge sums were calculated for muons and taus:\n",
        "    *   `muon_charge_sum`: Mean $\\sim0.03$, Median $0.00$.\n",
        "    *   `tau_charge_sum`: Mean $\\sim0.05$, Median $0.00$.\n",
        "*   The total scalar sum of transverse momenta for leptons (`HT_leptons`) was calculated, with a mean of $\\sim152.90$ GeV, a median of $\\sim124.85$ GeV, and a maximum observed value of $\\sim109.5$ TeV.\n",
        "*   The invariant mass of the leading muon-tau pair (`muon_tau_invariant_mass`) was calculated, showing a broad distribution with a mean of $\\sim45.38$ GeV, a median of $\\sim5.63$ GeV, and a maximum observed value of $\\sim5.7$ TeV.\n",
        "*   Charge asymmetries were calculated: muon charge asymmetry was $\\sim0.0358$, and tau charge asymmetry was $\\sim0.0279$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The observed slight positive charge asymmetries for muons and taus warrant further investigation. Comparing these values against Standard Model predictions and carefully evaluating potential detector effects or event selection biases would be crucial for drawing definitive conclusions about anti-matter asymmetry.\n",
        "*   While no clear signature for \"vacuum tension\" was found in the leading muon-tau invariant mass spectrum in this preliminary analysis, further studies could involve applying tighter event selection criteria, incorporating background estimations, and comparing distributions with specific theoretical models that predict new physics signals at particular mass points.\n"

This is precisely how we learn about the fundamental aspects of matter and energy—by testing hypotheses against the undeniable truth of experimental data.\n",

        "This report details a preliminary analysis conducted on a subset of the `Run2012C_TauPlusX.root` dataset, focusing on muons and taus to investigate potential signatures of 'Anti-Matter Asymmetry' and 'Vacuum Tension (0.15)'. A total of 1 million events were analyzed from the full dataset, which contains approximately 51 million events. The analysis revealed slight positive charge asymmetries for both muons (~0.0358) and taus (~0.0279), indicating a minor excess of positively charged leptons. However, no distinct narrow peaks or unexpected deviations were observed in the leading muon-tau invariant mass distribution that would suggest new physics related to 'Vacuum Tension (0.15)'. It is important to note that, as per instruction, electron data was not included in this specific analysis due to persistent download issues with the relevant file.\n",
