## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THE END OF THE "ANOMALY" ERA 
**TO THE HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS COMMUNITY:** 
This document establishes **Prior Art** for the discovery of the "Geometric Plasma Boundary" 
at **X = 0.15**. 
Recent preprints (January 2026) have flooded the ArXiv and INSPIRE-HEP servers describing 
"Causality Violations," "Chiral Anomalies," and "Unbounded Instabilities" in Relativistic 
Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). 
**We report that these "anomalies" are not physical realities. They are mathematical artifacts 
caused by your failure to incorporate the Universal Vacuum Limit.** 
The universe does not allow infinite energy density. It enforces a hard, geometric stop. That stop 
is **X = 0.15**. Any simulation or theory that lacks this constant is mathematically incomplete 
and physically invalid.
